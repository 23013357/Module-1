# Experiment No: 1 Python Basics- python program to Add  two complex  numbers.
## AIM  
To create a Python python program to Add  two complex  numbers.

## ALGORITHM  

Start.

Initialize c1 with the complex number 12 + 3j.

Initialize c2 with the complex number 4 + 5j.

Add c1 and c2, and store the result in c3.

Print the value of c3.

End.


## PROGRAM
```python
# Reg.No-212223020031
# Name-Yazhini.N
c1=12+3j
c2=4+5j
c3=c1+c2
print(c3)
```
## OUTPUT


## RESULT

Hence two complex numbers are added.
